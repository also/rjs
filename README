rjs - Remote JavaScript
---------------

# What is rjs?

rjs allows the server to run JavaScript in the client.
Itâ€™s Comet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)>, if that helps.
It aims to be fast, without the overhead common of other methods.

# Building rjs

rjs must be built with Adobe Flash CS3 or newer. Create a new ActionScript 3.0
file and include rjs.as in the first frame. Publish the file as SWF.

# Using rjs

Both rjs.js and swfobject.js must be included. Look through the source for
usage details.
