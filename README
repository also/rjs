rjs - Remote JavaScript
---------------

# What is rjs?

rjs allows the server to run JavaScript in the client.
Itâ€™s Comet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)>, if that helps.
It aims to be fast, without the overhead common of other methods.

# Building rjs

rsj can be built using the freely available Flex 3 SDK. Simply run
flex_sdk_3/bin/mxmlc as/Rjs.as to generate a functional SWF file.

# Using rjs

Both rjs.js and swfobject.js must be included. Look through the source for
usage details.
